MealTracker
A program to record meal times and nutritional composition
People can record their meal times, the nutrients included (including grains, protein, vegetables, fruits dairy and snacks), and create a report.

People want to know if the diet they consume contains different kinds of nutrients

How do you make it simple for users to record the composition of their food and generate an easily recognizable report?
