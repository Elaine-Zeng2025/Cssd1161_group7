# Team Working Agreements

## Communication Norms

### Communication Channels
All project decisions and important discussions will be documented in GitHub Issues and Pull Request comments. Slack is used for quick questions and daily coordination, but any decisions made there must be documented in the appropriate GitHub Issue within 24 hours.

### Response Times
Team members are expected to respond to GitHub mentions and PR reviews within 24 hours on weekdays, and 48 hours on weekends. For urgent matters, use Slack with @mention, expecting responses within 2-4 hours during working hours (9am-6pm).

### Meeting Etiquette
All team members should join meetings on time and come prepared by reviewing the agenda beforehand. One person speaks at a time, cameras should be on when possible, and meeting notes must be posted to the project wiki within 24 hours by the designated scribe.

### Pull Request Tone
PR reviews should be constructive and respectful, focusing on the code not the person. Use "we" instead of "you" when suggesting improvements (e.g., "We could improve this by..." instead of "You should..."), and always include at least one positive comment along with any requested changes.

### Bullet pointed from Activity 2
[] AI reminders (e.g. "You've been low on protein lately, here's a quick chicken pasta recipe")
[] Earn badges or that fire emoji streak (e.g. You've been consistent for 7 days now, nice work!)
[] Give AI - driven recomendations that pop up related to your personalized goals!
