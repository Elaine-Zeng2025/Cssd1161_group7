1) Project Overview
1.1 Problem Statement
Solve the problem of complex meal tracking and lack of intuitive nutrition visualization for health-conscious people with a simple meal logging and reporting tool.
1.2 Users
Primary users: Health-conscious people (fitness enthusiasts, those with dietary goals)
User needs:
    1. Log meals quickly (clear categories);
    2. View nutrition reports intuitively;
    3. Cross-device access.
1.3 Value Proposition
Stand out with a balance of simplicity and visualization—log meals in a few clicks, reports show nutrition data in colorful, intuitive visuals for easy healthy eating management.
1.4 Goals & Non‑Goals
 Goals: Implement core screens (Login, Add, Report, success states); support meal type and food group selection; generate basic visual reports.
 Non‑Goals: No integration with external nutrition databases, no mobile app (only web responsiveness).

2）Requirements
2.1 Acceptance Criteria (Given/When/Then)
Acceptance Criteria (Given/When/Then)
US01: Given a valid account, enter email/password and click login, successfully enter index.
US02: Given on “Add” page, fill info and submit, get success notification and save log.
2.2 Assumptions & Constraints
Assumptions: Users know basic web operations, use modern browsers.
Constraints: 4-week development, front-end only (no backend), multi-device support.

3）User Flows
3.1
Flow 1: Login→Add→AddSuccess: User can log in, log a meal, and get success confirmation.
Flow 2: Index→Report→Index: User can generate a report and return to index easily.

3.2 Accessibility in Design
Color contrast: Meets WCAG AA; Keyboard navigation: Interactive elements support Tab traversal; Form labels are clear.
Attach key screen screenshots (e.g., Login, Add Meal).
