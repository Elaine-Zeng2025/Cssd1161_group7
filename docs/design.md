1) Project Overview
1.1 Problem Statement

1.2 Users
Primary users: Health-conscious people (fitness enthusiasts, those with dietary goals)
User needs:
    1. Log meals quickly (clear categories);
    2. View nutrition reports intuitively;
    3. Cross-device access.
1.3 Value Proposition
Stand out with a balance of simplicity and visualization—log meals in a few clicks, reports show nutrition data in colorful, intuitive visuals for easy healthy eating management.
1.4 Goals & Non‑Goals
 Goals: Implement core screens (Login, Add, Report, success states); support meal type and food group selection; generate basic visual reports.
 Non‑Goals: No integration with external nutrition databases, no mobile app (only web responsiveness).
